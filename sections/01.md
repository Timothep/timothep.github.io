I discussed your employment with my partner and we agree to your conditions. You can start tomorrow. Please show up at our office in Chicago at 8:00 am. The receptionist will be waiting for you and wilI introduce you to Alex, your team lead.

As you know your whole mission is time critical. The features we promised have to be implemented before the trade-show in 4 weeks or we can shut down the company. It if wasn’t bad enough already, the team has had a lot on its plate in the past months. I’m not sure how much they can still cope with.

Your mission is to get in there, help them release the features and see that they start the next release cycle on the right foot.

Looking forward to the promised results!
Jay Effkey
